Remaining work
--------------
Lambdas
Constraints
Type checking
HOFs (ensure they are working correctly)
Closures (ensure they are working correctly)

Potential future work
---------------------
 - Consider whether we can allow for the input string alive for the lifetime of the interpreter to avoid string copies
 - Rework logging to tie concrete types to the particular error so that we can have compile-time type checking for structured errors
 - Rename to element to prevent liblibelement
